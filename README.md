# Water-Wise-Demo
The purpose of this project is to demo the IF Water-Wise plugin

Check correct if-plugin is linked with this command:
```
npm ls -g --depth=0 --link=true
```

Make sure to build changes in the linked `if-plugins` repo:
```
npm run build
```

Run this after making updates to the local plugin
```
npm link @grnsft/if-plugins
```

## Installation/Build Instructions

Install IF framework, official, and unofficial plugins as described in the docs

To run the manifest file:
```
npx ie --manifest ../water-wise-demo/manifests/water-wise-demo.yml --output computed#water
```

## Scenario

We are deploying an ML application with most traffic in North Africa.  We need to decide between which region to deploy the app.
How do we make this decision?

* europe versus middle east vs us west
* azure vs aws vs gcp

Application specs:
-database instance
-serverless app
-docker deployed
- ML app

## Notes
Industry average WUE is 1.8 liters / kWH

Cooling methods:
* direct evaporative cooling (preferred) = hot air is pushed through water-soaked cooling pads, reducing air's temp
* free-air cooling = when conditions within safe operating ranges, deactivates evaporative cooling system
* adiabatic cooling = uses outside air when temps < 85 deg

Strategies for Water Positive
* Improving water use efficiency across its operations
* Using sustainable water sources (e.g., recycled water)
* Returning water for community reuse
* Supporting water replenishment projects for communities and the environment

Data center conditions:
* Recommended temperature in data centers maintained within range 
of 18째C to 27째C (64째F to 81째F)
* humidity levels for data centers should fall within the range of 40% to 60%


### AWS
20 data centers use recycled water = Virginia, California, Oregon, United Kingdowm, Spain, Brazil, South Africa, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Australia

Global WUE is 0.19 L/KWh


### Microsoft
FY22 withdrew 10.7 million cubic meters
discharges 4.3 million cubic meters

### Google
withdrew 6.6 billion gallons
discharged 1.4 billion gallons
